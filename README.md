# Movie-Streaming

I am very passionate about looking up the movies I love and finding out their ratings.🦸🏻‍♀️ So, I built this Movie Database search engine for users of the same
interest. When the user submits the title of the movie, a number of corresponding movies are displayed including their posters, titles, ratings, and the movie overview when one hovers over the movie card.

Coding Achievements:

- Used async/await/fetch to get data from the Movie Database API
- Created HTML elements in javascript
- Looped through the movie attributes and injected them into the DOM
- Used the if/else statement to assign each rating range a certain color
